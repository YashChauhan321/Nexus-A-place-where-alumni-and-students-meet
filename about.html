            <p><b>About Nexus: The Creator Behind Your Connected Campus
            </b>

            <br><b>The Visionary Behind the Code:</b><br>
            Nexus is the brainchild of Yash Chauhan, a B.Tech (C.S) student with a deep understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by college campuses.

            I saw the potential for technology to bridge the gap between students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Inspired by the desire to create a vibrant and interconnected college environment, Nexus was born.</p>
        <p><br>
            <b>Our Mission: Building a Stronger Community:</b><br>

            Our mission is simple: to empower your college by fostering connections and making valuable resources readily available. We believe that a strong and connected community is the foundation for a thriving student experience.<br>
        <p><br>
            <b>What Drives Us:</b><br>
